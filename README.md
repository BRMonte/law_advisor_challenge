# law_advisor_challenge

This repo brings 2 main files: foo_bar.rb and foo_bar_spec.rb.

In the first we have 2 methods: 

#foo_bar_rule brings the filter and the effect caused on the items, in other words, provides the logic.
#foo_bar effectively perform the logic action, do some validation and return a result.

In foo_bar_spec.rb we have simple tests for checking when input is invalid.
